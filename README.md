This is my first project in java. I decided to make it a rock paper scissors game for it's simplicity, I learn new things as I go.

The core concept of the game is that you're playing rock paper scissors against an AI called Mr. RPS that is experiencing a bug in it's code that slowly causes it to go rogue as you play the game.

This project is meant as a way to showcase some of my skills applied in a practical environment.
